# R Workflows for Metabolomics and Proteomics ðŸ“ŠðŸ”¬

This folder contains R-based workflows and scripts used for **metabolomics** and **proteomics** analysis. We use these tools to analyze and interpret large-scale biological data, including data from mass spectrometry experiments.

### Key Components:
- **Chemometrics**: Methods for statistical analysis, data preprocessing, and feature selection.
- **xcms**: An R package used for **untargeted metabolomics analysis**, handling peak detection, alignment, and quantification.
- **PCA & Clustering**: Multivariate analysis techniques to explore relationships between samples and detect patterns in complex datasets.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Various R-based statistical methods for hypothesis testing and data visualization.

These workflows are crucial for interpreting complex data in our projects and allow us to uncover insights in metabolomics and proteomics.

Feel free to explore, modify, or add new scripts and workflows to improve the analysis pipeline! ðŸŒ¿
