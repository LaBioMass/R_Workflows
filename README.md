Welcome to the **LaBioMass Laboratory** project repository! This space serves as a central hub for storing links and references related to our research projects. Here, you will find:

- 📚 Links to our **articles** and published research.
- 🧑‍🔬 Workflows and pipelines for **metabolomics** and **proteomics** analysis, including:
  - **MSDIAL** for untargeted metabolomics analysis 🌿.
  - **GNPS** for network-based metabolomics analysis 🔗.
  - **R** for statistical and multivariate analysis in both metabolomics and proteomics, including **chemometrics** and the **xcms** package 📊.
  
Our goal is to create a collaborative environment where resources, code, and documentation are easily accessible to everyone involved in our projects. 🤝

Feel free to contribute by adding workflows, references, or suggesting improvements! 🌟
